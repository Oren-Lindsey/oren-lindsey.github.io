## Books in the Attic
While cleaning up in the attic, I found about 50 nonfiction books that look very interesting: ![Books in the attic](/posts/book-reviews/books.jpeg)

## My Plan
My plan is to read them all throughout 2026, and write about them on this blog. You can find a list of all of them [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-gHygCMivYy_aGNMJ_B9bqbU0vQgTzuRycT2gUGlVsI/edit?usp=sharing). Most of them are Christian-focused, which may not be of interest to you, but I hope writing about them will be somewhat interesting.

I'm almost finished with one of these books (Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life, by Donald Whitney). This will be my first review, which I'll write pretty soon. My next book after that will be 9 Marks of a Healthy Church. We'll see how long this series lasts, I hope to continue all year, but that will be hard.
